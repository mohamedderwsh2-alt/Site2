// Note: Full i18n implementation would require Next.js middleware configuration
// This is a basic setup that can be expanded. For now, the platform uses English
// but the structure is ready for multi-language support.

// To fully implement i18n:
// 1. Create middleware.ts to handle locale routing
// 2. Update app structure to use [locale] folder
// 3. Configure next-intl properly with middleware
// 4. Add more language files in messages/

// For now, the platform is functional in English and ready for i18n expansion.
